## Overview

At [Project Name], we emphasize a clean and modular codebase through thoughtful organization. Our folder structure is designed to encourage maintainability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns.

## High-Level Structure

The project's root directory contains the following main folders:
src/
|-- assets/
|   |-- images/
|   |-- styles/
|-- components/
|   |-- common/
|   |-- layout/
|   |-- UIComponent1/
|   |-- UIComponent2/
|-- hooks/
|-- services/
|-- pages/
|-- utils/
|-- App.js
|-- index.js



## Key Directories

- **`assets/`**: Contains static assets like images, fonts, and global styles.

- **`hooks/`**: Holds custom hooks that encapsulate reusable functionality.

- **`components/`**: Holds all kinds of components related to UI, the common ones as well.

- **`services/`**: Contains API services and utility functions for external interactions.

- **`utils/`**: Holds utility functions and helper modules.

- **`pages/`**: Holds pages that are displayed directly to the user.

## Guidelines

- Keep components focused: Each component should serve a specific purpose and ideally be reusable.

- Use feature folders: Organize components, containers, and styles within feature folders for a clearer codebase.

- Maintain consistency: Follow established patterns to ensure a consistent structure and coding style.
